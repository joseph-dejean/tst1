# Login with the account in which you have access of the project for deployment

gcloud auth login

# Step 2: Set the project in which you are going to deploy this application
# Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the actuall Project id in the below command before running it

gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Step 3: Enable Cloud run and artifact API's for deployment
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com

# Step 4: Clone the repo into you Cloud shell or in case of Google cloud SDK clone it into the installed computer

git clone https://github.com/link-to-this-repo-for-clonning

# After clonning go inside the clonned repo

cd dataplex-buisness-user-ui

# Now before building the container if we want to do any default configs setting for ui change we can do that via changing the configData.json inside the backend folder check the readme file to see how to do this. 
vi backend/configData.json // or use any code/text editor

# Step 5: Create the artifact repository to store the container artifact, this command require to run only once for the deployment if you are re-deplying skip this step

# Replace \`[REPO_NAME]\` with the name you want to give like (dataplex-buisness-ui-artifact, etc.) and set up your preferred region by setting that in --location flag below command is using \`us-central1\` but you can replace it but make sure if you replace it then use the same region in below steps by replacing \`us-central1\` with the the used value.

gcloud artifacts repositories create \`[REPO_NAME]\` --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1 --description="Docker repository for dataplex-buisness-ui project"

# Step 6 Build the Docker Image with Cloud Build
# Submit your project to Google Cloud Build to create a container image. Replace \`[PROJECT_ID]\`with your GCP Project ID,\`[REPO_NAME]\` which you created in the step 5 and \`[APP_NAME]\`with your desired application name.

gcloud builds submit . --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/[REPO_NAME]/[APP_NAME]:latest

# Step 7: Deploy to Cloud Run
# Replace the [PROJECT_ID],[REPO_NAME],[APP_NAME] with the value you have used above and replace [SERVICE_NAME] with the name you want to set your cloud run service, [ADMIN_EMAIL_ID] to your admin email you want to set, then the most important replace the [CLIENT_ID] and [CLIENT_SCERET] with the OAuth credentials you created in earlier steps.

          <li>
            <Typography><strong>Aspects:</strong> The <strong>Aspect</strong> filter allows you to refine search results based on the metadata and tags that have been applied to data assets, often by Data Stewards. These tags provide critical context, helping you quickly understand the nature of the data before viewing the details. For example, you can filter by:
</Typography>
            <ul>
              <li><Typography>Data Quality: Show only assets that have been tagged as meeting
                specific quality standards.</Typography></li>

            <Typography><strong>Assets:</strong> The <strong>Assets</strong> filter allows you to narrow your search based on the type of data resource itself. This is useful when you are looking for a specific kind of artifact, regardless of which Google Cloud product it came from. The Studio pulls metadata about many asset types. Examples of assets you can filter by include:</Typography>
            <ul>

            <Typography><strong>Products:</strong> The <strong>Products</strong> filter allows you to focus your search on data assets originating from a specific Google Cloud service. This helps if you know the general location of the data you are seeking. The Studio centralizes metadata from many sources across your organization's data landscape. Examples of products you can filter by include:</Typography>
            <ul>

            <Typography><strong>Projects:</strong> The <strong>Projects</strong> filter allows you to limit the displayed results to assets located within one or more specific Google Cloud Projects (Project IDs). Organizations often use different projects to logically separate data environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production, or different business units). By selecting a Project ID, you can ensure your search is only looking at the assets relevant to that particular environment.</Typography>
